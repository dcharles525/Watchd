This is version 0.0.1

I will be updating this repo as time goes on, so far I have adjusted the battery calculation, and removed additional watch faces. 

I've also tried disabling a few things to make the battery life even better than it is. 

My todos: 
1) Figure out proper battery calc and document
2) Make a refined watch face
3) Fully document how to upload thie firmware to the watch (Watchy)
4) See if I can add mods to the board
